External Links Snippet for Chromeless Apps
==========================================

Open external links in a new window when your web app runs in a chromeless runtime.

Useful for Firefox OS and iOS web apps! Created and tested in Firefox.

Why it doesn't suck:

 - Event delegation: Fast load and works on dynamic content
 - Doesn't use `window.open`, just changes the `target` for clicked links
 - Keeps existing `target` references intact
 - Vanilla JavaScript, the best cross-browser framework!

Copy into your site, embed deferred via github or just get inspired and make your own.
